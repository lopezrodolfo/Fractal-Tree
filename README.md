# Fractal Tree

## Description

This project displays a fractal tree using Python's Tkinter library. The fractal tree is generated through recursive drawing, allowing users to visualize complex patterns with adjustable levels of recursion.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Download or clone the repository.
3. Navigate to the directory containing `fractal_tree.py`.
4. Run the script using the command:
   ```bash
   python fractal_tree.py
   ```

## Controls

- **Advance**: Increases the level of recursion, adding more branches to the fractal tree.
- **Reset**: Resets the fractal tree to its initial state with one level of recursion.
- **Quit**: Closes the application.

## Features

- Adjustable recursion levels to explore different fractal patterns.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
